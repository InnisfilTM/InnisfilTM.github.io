<p>If and when our times and location change we will update on this site and on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/innisfiltoastmasters">Facebook Page</a>.</p>


<h3>What can I expect?</h3>
<p>
We do our best to prepare well in advance before every meeting and set an agenda. Here's an <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/agenda-example.pdf">example</a> of what an agenda looks like.</p>

<p>The format of a typical meeting becomes very familiar after a few visits, and will be similar at many other Toastmasters clubs.</p>

<p>We break the meeting usually into two portions.
The first part of the meeting is prepared speeches and possibly an Educational portion.
The second part everyone is welcomeÂ to participate in either Table Topics or some other club discussion to practice public speaking, followed by excellent evaluations and feedback.</p>
