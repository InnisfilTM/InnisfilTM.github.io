  <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>oastmasters is a place where you develop and grow - both personally and professionally. You join a community of
  learners, and in Toastmasters meetings we learn by doing. Whether you're an executive or a stay-at-home parent, a
  college student or a retiree, you will improve yourself; building skills to express yourself in a variety of situations.
  You'll open up a world of new possibilities: giving better work presentations; leading meetings - and participating in
  them - more confidently; speaking more smoothly off the cuff; even handling one-on-one interactions with family, friends
  and colleagues more smoothly off the cuff; even handling one-on-one interactions with family, friends and colleagues
  more positively.</p>  
    
  <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
  <p>The environment in a Toastmasters club is friendly and supportive. Everyone at a Toastmasters meeting feels welcome and
  valued - from complete beginners to advanced speakers. In a club meeting, you practice giving prepared speeches as well
  as brief impromptu presentations, known as Table Topics. There is no rush and no pressure: The Toastmasters program
  allows you to progress at your own pace.</p>

  <h2>Where We Meet</h2>
  <p>
  We meet on the 1st and 3rd Thursday of every month from 7:30 - 9:00 pm
  Innisfil Community Church 1571 Innisfil Beach Road, Innisfil, ON
